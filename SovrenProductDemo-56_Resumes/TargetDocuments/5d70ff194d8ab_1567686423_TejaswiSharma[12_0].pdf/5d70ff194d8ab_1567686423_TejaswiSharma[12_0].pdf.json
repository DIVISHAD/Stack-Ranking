They all are mostly into\r\neducation portfolio business and generate leads for universities in US.\r\n●   We have about 250+ websites to maintain for new features, seo updates and other\r\nworks.\r\n●   Some of the big sites that we maintain are w ww.accreditedonlinecolleges.org,\r\nwww.collegeathome.com, www.edudemic.com\r\n●   We are a very small team(4 people) but we are single handedly managing work of this\r\nmagnitude alone.\r\n●   To achieve this kind of work we have created lots of tools and have automated most of\r\nour works. For example one of the things in our compliance matrix is that all the sites in our portfolio should be mobile friendly to google. We have created a script which uses\r\nselenium and checks each and every website of ours on google website that it's mobile\r\nfriendly or not. If it sees some url is not complying it sends a mail to us and we\r\nimmediately look into it.\r\n●   Most of our websites in wordpress so we have developed many themes and plugin for\r\nour websites to do many things.\r\n●   We have also developed many reporting tools which uses google analytics and webmasters apis and keep checking our websites on the parameters we have set. If any\r\nparameter (eg. bounceRate, totalPageviews etc) is going haywire it sends us reports\r\nimmediately and we focus only on those issues.\r\n●   In addition to that we maintain all the backend servers of the company. We have the the biggest of instances that AWS(amazon) can offer and we maintain each and every\r\naspect of it. We have automated this process also by using chef and knife tools.\r\nTechnologies Used:\r\n\r\nApache, PHP, HTML, CSS, Mysql, Javascript, NodeJs, Haraka, Varnish, EC2, ELB, Route53,\r\nS3, Aurora RDS, Symfony, Twig, jQuery, AngularJs, Bootstrap, Wordpress, Less, Sass, Git,\r\nZabbix, Selenium, Webpagetest, Chef, Nginx, Jenkins CI",
