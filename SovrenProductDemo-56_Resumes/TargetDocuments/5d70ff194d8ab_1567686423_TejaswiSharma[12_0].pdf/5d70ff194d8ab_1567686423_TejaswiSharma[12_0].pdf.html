● This company is a offshore development center for stripes39 group of companies. Our <BR>
primary clients are concept.com, cmn.com, educationlabs.com. They all are mostly into <BR>
education portfolio business and generate leads for universities in US. <BR>
● We have about 250+ websites to maintain for new features, seo updates and other <BR>
works. <BR>
● Some of the big sites that we maintain are w ww.accreditedonlinecolleges.org, <BR>
www.collegeathome.com, &nbsp;www.edudemic.com . <BR>
● We are a very small team(4 people) but we are single handedly managing work of this <BR>
magnitude alone. <BR>
● To achieve this kind of work we have created lots of tools and have automated most of <BR>
our works. For example one of the things in our compliance matrix is that all the sites in <BR>
our portfolio should be mobile friendly to google. We have created a script which uses <BR>
selenium and checks each and every website of ours on google website that it's mobile <BR>
friendly or not. If it sees some url is not complying it sends a mail to us and we <BR>
immediately look into it. <BR>
● Most of our websites in wordpress so we have developed many themes and plugin for <BR>
our websites to do many things. <BR>
● We have also developed many reporting tools which uses google analytics and <BR>
webmasters apis and keep checking our websites on the parameters we have set. If any <BR>
parameter (eg. bounceRate, totalPageviews etc) is going haywire it sends us reports <BR>
immediately and we focus only on those issues. <BR>
● In addition to that we maintain all the backend servers of the company. We have the the <BR>
biggest of instances that AWS(amazon) can offer and we maintain each and every <BR>
aspect of it. We have automated this process also by using chef and knife tools. <P class="std" >&nbsp;</P>
