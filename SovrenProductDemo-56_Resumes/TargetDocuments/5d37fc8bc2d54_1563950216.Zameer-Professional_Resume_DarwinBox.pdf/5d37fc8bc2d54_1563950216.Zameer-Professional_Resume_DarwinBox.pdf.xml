						<sov:Level>Fatal Problems Found</sov:Level>
						<sov:Findings>
							<sov:Information>[Sovren:416;] We found no EDUCATION HISTORY section header for the candidate, but we calculated where we thought EDUCATION HISTORY was located in the resume. The education history section should have a header such as 'Education' before listing the content.</sov:Information>

					<sov:Assessment>
						<sov:Level>Major Issues Found</sov:Level>
						<sov:Findings>
							<sov:Information>[Sovren:303;4] The following section in the resume contains more content than the work history and education sections combined: Section with index 4 (of type: QUALIFICATIONS SUMMARY). This may indicate a problem with section headers, formatting, or content.</sov:Information>
							<sov:Information>[Sovren:323;QUALIFICATIONS_SUMMARY] The following section type appeared multiple times in the resume: QUALIFICATIONS_SUMMARY (2 occurrences). Each section type should only appear once in a resume.</sov:Information>
							<sov:Information>[Sovren:324;0] The following section does not have any text: 'SKILLS'. Every section should have text associated with it. This usually indicates an error with the section headers or format used in the resume.</sov:Information>
							<sov:Information>[Sovren:325;3,4] The following section does not have a header: Section with index 3 (of type: EDUCATION), Section with index 4 (of type: QUALIFICATIONS SUMMARY). Every section should have a header directly above the content associated with it.</sov:Information>
						</sov:Findings>
					</sov:Assessment>
					<sov:Assessment>
						<sov:Level>Suggested Improvements</sov:Level>
						<sov:Findings>
							<sov:Information>[Sovren:112;] The following section was identified as a skills section type: 'SKILLS'. Skills should not be in a separate section, but instead, each skill should be included in the descriptions of work history or education.</sov:Information>
