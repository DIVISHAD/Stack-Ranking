Mahindra Satyam <BR>
The client involved was a Multi-National Bank’s Switzerland operations. The project involved managing the production <BR>
support and application maintenance on ownership basis. My tasks and contributions involved as below: - <BR>
• 24x7 work cycle, night support for production batches on rotation basis, &nbsp;<BR>
• Interacting with several vendor partners before, during and post batch for Inputs, mainframes issues Outputs at <BR>
their end. &nbsp;<BR>
• Coding change requests for creating new functionalities from scratch. &nbsp;<BR>
• Running test batches, region builds for Change requests. <BR>
• Automated manual work required for extracting reports post batch resulting in 90 percent reduction of time <BR>
required for report generation. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
My personal best tech memory:- Created an Automation Tool for reporting batch data directly to all parties via SMS and Email in less <BR>
than 2 weeks. &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Problem Solved:- It used to take 2 hours each morning for people to manually extract select data from mainframe batch files in excel <BR>
sheets and send it across to all parties. (We had an average of 10 million transactions processed each night using mainframes for <BR>
this banking client) It was a high dependency work and even after careful extraction, manual errors would occur a few times, resulting <BR>
in inconvenience to all parties. &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Solution:- To make the entire process automated and remove human intervention and hence removing errors and drastically reducing <BR>
the time. &nbsp;<BR>

I took the initiative from my side to create this tool, I used two never before used languages to create this tool ( REXX, E asytrieve). <BR>
Normally when one was introduced to Mainframes you are only taught and COBOL, JCL, VSAM, DB2. I consider these tools as kind of <BR>
scripting language and glue tools to do things fast. REXX has similar power as C, I felt, it was easy to write and take complete control <BR>
of formatting and editing. Easytrieve helped a lot with the extraction of data from mainframes files. In the end, I learned about setting <BR>
up SMS and SMTP server on mainframes. This was also my 1st collaboration lesson, in the process, I reached out to complete <BR>
strangers, within the company whom I knew could help, I interacted with clients to understand their pain points. &nbsp;<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
Result:- &nbsp;<BR>
1) The time got reduced to 10 minutes as an average depending on the day's load. <BR>
2) 0 errors. &nbsp;<BR>
3) It gave a better experience to all the parties that depended on that report. <BR>
4) Made me confident that I was on right career path. As the computer is meant to automate, speed up, make lives convenient. <BR>
