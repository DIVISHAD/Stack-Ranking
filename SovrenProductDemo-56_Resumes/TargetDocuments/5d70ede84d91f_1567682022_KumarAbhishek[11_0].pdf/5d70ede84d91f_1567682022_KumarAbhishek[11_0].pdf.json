The project involved managing th e production\r\nsupport and application maintenance on ownership basis. My tasks and contributions involved as below: -\r\n•\t24x7 work cycle, night support for production batches on rotation basis,\r\n\r\n•\tInteracting with several vendor partners before, during and post b atch for Inputs, mainframes issues Outputs at their end.\r\n\r\n•\tCoding change requests for creating new functionalities from scratch\r\n\r\n•\tRunning test batches, region builds for Change requests.\r\n\r\n•\tAutomated manual work required for extracting reports post batch resulting in 90 percent reduction of time\r\nrequired for report generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personal best tech memory:- Created an Automation Tool for reporting batch data directly to all parties via SMS and Email in less\r\nthan 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nProblem Solved:- It used to take 2 hours each morning for people to manually extract select data from mainframe batch files in excel\r\nsheets and send it across to all parties. (We had an average of 10 million transactions processed each night using mainframes fo r this banking client) It was a high dependency work and even after careful extraction, manual errors would occur a few times, resulting in inconvenience to all parties.\r\n\r\nSolution:- To make the entire process automated and remove human intervention and hence removing errors and drastically reducing the time.\r\nI took the initiative from my side to create this tool, I used two never before used languages to create this tool (REXX, E asytrieve).\r\nNormally when one was introduced to Mainframes you are only taught and COBOL, JCL, VSAM, DB2. I consider these tools as kind of scripting language and glue tools to do things fast. REXX has similar power as C, I felt, it was easy to write and t ake complete control of formatting and editing. Easytrieve helped a lot with the extraction of data from mainframes files. In the end, I learned a bout setting\r\nup SMS and SMTP server on mainframes. This was also my 1st collaboration lesson, in the process, I reached out to complete\r\nstrangers, within the company whom I knew could help, I interacted with clients to understand their pain points.\r\n\r\nResult:-\r\n1) The time got reduced to 10 minutes as an average depending on the day's load.\r\n2) 0 errors.\r\n3) It gave a better experience to all the parties that depended on that report.\r\n4) Made me confident that I was on right career path. As the computer is meant to automate, speed up, make lives convenient.",

Leading weekly meetings, ensure representation from each module, brainstorm new\r\nideas, allocation of ideas to various teams for feasibility checks, taking successfully tested ideas to client for\r\nproduction approval and implementation.\r\n\r\n•\tConducted engineering interviews and took knowledge transfer sessions for onboarding,\r\n\r\n•\tAwards: - On the Spot Awards for Outstanding Contribution to the Project\r\n\r\nVarious client recognitions and pat on backs.\r\n\r\nFreelance Photographer\tSep 2011 - June 2013\r\n\r\nKumar Abhishek Photography\r\n•\tPursued Photography and focused on street Photography.\r\n•\tGot Selected for National Geography Moments Awards 2013 Kolkata Photo walk.\r\n•\tSome of my work can be viewed here 500px.\r\n\r\nDeveloper\tApr 2012 - July 2012\r\nANZ (Australia New-Zealand Bank Operations and Technology)\r\n•\tLead and coded Automation tool for test batch execution bringing down manual efforts by 25 percent.\r\n\r\n•\tLead SIT, UAT testing for various new projects, incident management and resolution\r\n\r\n•\tContributed with major documentations; one on complete process flow for testing and another on legacy business\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nSoftware Engineer\tDec 2009 - Aug 2011\r\nHSBC\r\n•\tCore member of MasterCard / Visa Compliance team, developing new and enhancing existing code base to\r\nincorporate compliance guidelines\r\n\r\n•\tExecuting SIT and UAT batches of the compliance changes, handling defects and parallel implementation across\r\nmultiple countries.\r\n\r\n•\tCreated new automation tools for speeding up bug resolution, and smart guidance for any user facing similar\r\nissues\r\n\r\n•\tWorked on a down-sink project which required conversion pr ograms for various files.\r\n\r\n•\tCoaching and mentoring new team members, creating documentation and assets for easy Knowledge transfer.\r\n\r\nSoftware Engineer\tOct 2007 - Nov 2009\r\nMahindra Satyam\r\nThe client involved was a Multi-National Bank's Switzerland operations. The project involved managing th e production\r\nsupport and application maintenance on ownership basis. My tasks and contributions involved as below: -\r\n•\t24x7 work cycle, night support for production batches on rotation basis,\r\n\r\n•\tInteracting with several vendor partners before, during and post b atch for Inputs, mainframes issues Outputs at\r\ntheir end.\r\n\r\n•\tCoding change requests for creating new functionalities from scratch\r\n\r\n•\tRunning test batches, region builds for Change requests.\r\n\r\n•\tAutomated manual work required for extracting reports post batch resulting in 90 percent reduction of time\r\nrequired for report generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personal best tech memory:- Created an Automation Tool for reporting batch data directly to all parties via SMS and Email in less\r\nthan 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nProblem Solved:- It used to take 2 hours each morning for people to manually extract select data from mainframe batch files in excel\r\nsheets and send it across to all parties. (We had an average of 10 million transactions processed each night using mainframes fo r\r\nthis banking client) It was a high dependency work and even after careful extraction, manual errors would occur a few times, resulting\r\nin inconvenience to all parties.\r\n\r\nSolution:- To make the entire process automated and remove human intervention and hence removing errors and drastically reducing\r\nthe time.\r\nI took the initiative from my side to create this tool, I used two never before used languages to create this tool (REXX, E asytrieve).\r\nNormally when one was introduced to Mainframes you are only taught and COBOL, JCL, VSAM, DB2. I consider these tools as kind of\r\nscripting language and glue tools to do things fast. REXX has similar power as C, I felt, it was easy to write and t ake complete control\r\nof formatting and editing. Easytrieve helped a lot with the extraction of data from mainframes files. In the end, I learned a bout setting\r\nup SMS and SMTP server on mainframes. This was also my 1st collaboration lesson, in the process, I reached out to complete\r\nstrangers, within the company whom I knew could help, I interacted with clients to understand their pain points.\r\n\r\nResult:-\r\n1) The time got reduced to 10 minutes as an average depending on the day's load.\r\n2) 0 errors.\r\n3) It gave a better experience to all the parties that depended on that report.\r\n4) Made me confident that I was on right career path. As the computer is meant to automate, speed up, make lives convenient."
