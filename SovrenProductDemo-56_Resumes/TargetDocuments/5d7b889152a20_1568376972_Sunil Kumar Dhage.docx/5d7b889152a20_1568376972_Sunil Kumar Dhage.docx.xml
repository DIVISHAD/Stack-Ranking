Project: Flexible Access Agreement Phase-III	Nov '05 - May '06

Description:
IBIS system has a feature to capture all contract details of a subscriber. Once the contract is set active, a request is sent to SOP system through DB2 connect to place an order for FAA contract and produce invoice during overnight job execution. DB2 connect is a utility that connects application and data.DB2 Connect can invoke business logic in AS/400 system through stored procedures. Stored procedure (FAAPROC) would be created in SOP system to recognize the requests from FAA system passed through DB2 connect. FARPROC in turn invokes a program DB690 to place an order. DB690 identifies the type of contract (Upfront or IPP) to place orders appropriately. This results in immediate creation of order for FAA contract in SOP system. The placed orders are then picked by overnight job of SOP system to produce invoice at the end of business hours. Transactions between FAA and Non-FAA would be captured in SOP system to ease maintenance activity.
Data from contract management web interface to be sent to SOP,
Data from auto renewal batch process to be sent to SOP,
Credit Analysis Report depicting the details of the subscriber and the future contract which will be getting renewed between the specific dates.

Project: Common Test Portal	Jan '08 - Nov '08
Description:
The 3-tier test strategy requires a single common portal system to interface with the different test environment parameters to allow the user to use different test systems and select different parameters like baseline, configuration and nodes. CTP communicates with different systems like RIOT, Parameter DB, Delivery DB, Test engine through XMLs using SOAP protocols over the network. CTP uses MVC design pattern, CTP user Regulation module shall provide User Management and Test Plant booking functions. There will be Super user and admin user on top of general user. It will be developed using JSP. Different web modules developed in JSP to book the test sessions, baseline selection software selection, configuration selection, project and priority selections etc. These screens will be similar to shopping cart addition in multiple screens having next buttons and submitting the request in the final screen. Communication to other systems happens through WSDL.

Project: Flexible Access Agreement Phase-III	Nov '05 - May '06

Description:
IBIS system has a feature to capture all contract details of a subscriber. Once the contract is set active, a request is sent to SOP system through DB2 connect to place an order for FAA contract and produce invoice during overnight job execution. DB2 connect is a utility that connects application and data.DB2 Connect can invoke business logic in AS/400 system through stored procedures. Stored procedure (FAAPROC) would be created in SOP system to recognize the requests from FAA system passed through DB2 connect. FARPROC in turn invokes a program DB690 to place an order. DB690 identifies the type of contract (Upfront or IPP) to place orders appropriately. This results in immediate creation of order for FAA contract in SOP system. The placed orders are then picked by overnight job of SOP system to produce invoice at the end of business hours. Transactions between FAA and Non-FAA would be captured in SOP system to ease maintenance activity.
Data from contract management web interface to be sent to SOP,
Data from auto renewal batch process to be sent to SOP,
Credit Analysis Report depicting the details of the subscriber and the future contract which will be getting renewed between the specific dates.
Role: Senior Project Engineer
Responsibilities:

● Responsible for designing and coding of all the above modules.
● Responsible for TO's, Configurations, xml, xml mappings used for transferring the data from web interface as well as auto renewal batch.
● Responsible for design and coding of DAO's, UI's and IBM WebSphere MQ.
● Extracted the data from DB2 and MS-SQL databases using Abstract Factory design patterns and used JSP's for generating CSV for credit analysis report.
Environment: DB2/400,MS SQL Server, Sybase, JMS, MS Office, J2EE, JSP, Java Servlets, MQ series, Java, Eclipse, Covalent Tomcat, Windows XP.

					<sov:Description>Project: Common Test Portal	Jan '08 - Nov '08
Description:
The 3-tier test strategy requires a single common portal system to interface with the different test environment parameters to allow the user to use different test systems and select different parameters like baseline, configuration and nodes. CTP communicates with different systems like RIOT, Parameter DB, Delivery DB, Test engine through XMLs using SOAP protocols over the network. CTP uses MVC design pattern, CTP user Regulation module shall provide User Management and Test Plant booking functions. There will be Super user and admin user on top of general user. It will be developed using JSP. Different web modules developed in JSP to book the test sessions, baseline selection software selection, configuration selection, project and priority selections etc. These screens will be similar to shopping cart addition in multiple screens having next buttons and submitting the request in the final screen. Communication to other systems happens through WSDL.

					<sov:Description>IBIS system has a feature to capture all contract details of a subscriber. Once the contract is set active, a request is sent to SOP system through DB2 connect to place an order for FAA contract and produce invoice during overnight job execution. DB2 connect is a utility that connects application and data.DB2 Connect can invoke business logic in AS/400 system through stored procedures. Stored procedure (FAAPROC) would be created in SOP system to recognize the requests from FAA system passed through DB2 connect. FARPROC in turn invokes a program DB690 to place an order. DB690 identifies the type of contract (Upfront or IPP) to place orders appropriately. This results in immediate creation of order for FAA contract in SOP system. The placed orders are then picked by overnight job of SOP system to produce invoice at the end of business hours. Transactions between FAA and Non-FAA would be captured in SOP system to ease maintenance activity.
Data from contract management web interface to be sent to SOP,
Data from auto renewal batch process to be sent to SOP,
Credit Analysis Report depicting the details of the subscriber and the future contract which will be getting renewed between the specific dates.
